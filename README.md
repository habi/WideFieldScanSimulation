# WideFieldScan-Simulation

During my PhD at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch) of the [University of Bern](http://unibe.ch) I was running a SVN repository server on the [virtual server infrastructure](http://www.id.unibe.ch/content/services/hosting/virtuelle_server/) of the University of Bern.

Since I'm no longer working there I migrated all the code to GitHub, using `git svn clone http://code.ana.unibe.ch/svn/RepositoryName`

This repository contains (MATLAB) code that was used to simulate properties of the wide-field scanning modality I developed at [TOMCAT](http://www.psi.ch/sls/tomcat/) during my master thesis in the [Master of Advanced Studies in Medical Physics: IBT](http://www.mas-mp.ethz.ch).
In the end this led to a publication which is tracked in [this](http://github.com/habi/WideFieldScanPaper) repository.
